what_i_learned: |
  Today was a productive and exciting day. We visited BWI Airport, which gave us real-world insight into the environment our research is focused on—aviation operations. It was helpful to connect our project work with actual airport systems and think more deeply about how our AI flight delay prediction model could be applied in real scenarios. We also created our elevator pitch video, which helped me practice clearly and confidently communicating our project goals, impact, and innovation in a short amount of time. It made me more aware of how important it is to explain complex ideas in a way that’s both professional and easy to understand. In addition, I worked on refining our blog post to reflect our recent progress. Writing the blog helped me organize my thoughts and document the key milestones we've achieved so far.

reflection: |
  Visiting the airport and filming our elevator pitch was both inspiring and motivating. It reminded me why this research matters and how it could make a difference in the real world. Seeing the operations at BWI Airport up close helped me better visualize the challenges airlines and passengers face, especially when it comes to delays caused by unpredictable weather and other climate-related factors. It reinforced the importance of our work in building smarter, more resilient systems through AI. Creating the elevator pitch also pushed me to think critically about how to communicate our project to a broader audience. It wasn’t just about the technical aspects—it was about sharing our passion, our goals, and the potential impact of our solution in a way that resonates with people. I realized how powerful concise storytelling can be in research communication. Writing the blog post allowed me to reflect on how far we’ve come—from the early brainstorming stages to now having a clear direction, a working model, and an integrated dashboard. These moments of reflection are valuable—they remind me of the teamwork, the problem-solving, and the growth we’ve experienced as a team. Today felt like a turning point where everything started coming together with real purpose and confidence.
