what_i_learned: |
  
Today, I focused on gathering and reviewing academic resources related to the specific area I’m working on: climate resilience in airspace management using AI. I used Morgan State University's library database to search for relevant scholarly articles and successfully found 15 papers connected to my research. I reviewed four of these articles in detail and wrote summaries for each, identifying how they relate to our goal of predicting and mitigating climate-related flight disruptions. Additionally, I learned how to use Zotero, a research tool for collecting, organizing, and citing sources, which will help manage our references efficiently throughout the project.

  Initially, I had difficulty identifying which articles were most relevant to my research. It took time to filter through and choose papers that directly support my topic. Also, I was not familiar with Zotero before, so installing and setting it up took some extra time and guidance.

reflection: |
  Today’s work made me feel more confident in understanding the current research around climate change and aviation. Reading and summarizing scientific papers helped me connect the real-world impact of aviation emissions with the technical goals of our AI model. Learning to use Zotero was a valuable step toward staying organized and preparing for writing our final report. I feel more prepared now to continue diving deeper into the literature and strengthening the foundation for our research project.
