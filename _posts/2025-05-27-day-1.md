reflection: |
  It was great learning about Git & GitHub. I thought it would be complicated, but it’s actually pretty straightforward once explained clearly. In addition, we played a fun bingo activity that helped us get to know each other better, which made the atmosphere more relaxed and friendly. I’m excited about what’s ahead!
