what_i_learned: |
  I learned what Git and GitHub are, and how they support version control and collaboration in programming projects. We explored core commands like git init, git status, git add, and git commit, and discussed how GitHub helps us share and track our code online. I now understand the difference between local repositories and remote ones, which is very important for team-based development.
In addition, we took a Python placement test to assess our individual skill levels. This gave me a clear idea of what I need to work on and helped the instructors get a sense of our starting point. I realized I need to refresh some core Python concepts like loops and conditionals.
I also learned how Git helps prevent code conflicts and allows developers to work simultaneously without overwriting each other's work. This was especially interesting since I’m new to collaborative coding. Today’s session made it clear how vital version control will be in this internship.

blockers: |
  I didn’t face any major blockers today, but I was a bit unfamiliar with the Git command-line interface at first. It took a moment to understand the workflow between the working directory, staging area, and repository. I also got a bit confused between git pull and git fetch, but that’s something I plan to revisit in documentation later.

reflection: |
  It was great learning about Git and GitHub in a hands-on, beginner-friendly way. I had always heard developers mention these tools, but today I finally understood why they’re so powerful and essential in team coding environments. I now feel much more confident using them in future projects.
The Python placement test reminded me that it's okay not to know everything — this is a learning process. It gave me a good roadmap for what I need to brush up on. I’m motivated to improve my foundational coding skills as we move forward.
One of the highlights of the day was the bingo game, which helped us all break the ice and get to know one another. It felt good to laugh and find common experiences with peers from different backgrounds. The group is full of smart, kind, and interesting people — I’m excited to collaborate with them over the coming weeks.
