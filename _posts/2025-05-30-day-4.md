what_i_learned: |
  Today, we explored Large Language Models (LLMs) and how they work. I learned that LLMs are built using deep learning techniques, specifically transformer neural networks, and are trained on massive amounts of text data like books, websites, and conversations. We reviewed examples such as ChatGPT, Claude 3.5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, which power various AI tools today. During the Python session, I completed Lab 2: City Weather Log Analyzer. I wrote a program to collect city-temperature data, analyze averages and extremes, and generate a summary report using dictionaries and file handling.

blockers: |
  I initially struggled with entering input correctly in the "City,Temperature" format. Sometimes I hit Enter in the middle, which broke the program flow. I also encountered a small syntax error with brackets and numbers in Python, but I was able to fix it with a little debugging.

reflection: |
  Learning about LLMs helped me better understand the foundation behind tools like ChatGPT. The real coding practice made the AI concepts more relatable. I feel more confident in using Python to work with real data, and I’m excited to keep building my skills. This hands-on activity really helped connect AI theory with practical application.
