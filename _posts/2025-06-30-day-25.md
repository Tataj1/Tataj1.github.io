what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned how to create and host a free website using GitHub Pages. The tutorial walked through setting up a GitHub repository, uploading HTML files, and enabling GitHub Pages from the repository settings. I discovered that GitHub Pages can host personal, project, or organization websites for free. I also learned how to use the index.html file as the homepage and understood the role of branch selection (like main or gh-pages) in publishing a site. This process doesn't require a custom domain, but I can connect one if I want. This task also gave me useful knowledge that I can apply directly to my current project. Our graduate mentor also suggested this idea, which made it easier to connect the tutorial to our real work.

blockers: |  
  No major blockers today, but I’m still getting used to some of GitHub’s interface elements when working with repositories and settings. It took a bit of time to find where to enable GitHub Pages.
  
reflection: |
  Watching the videos helped me understand how easy it can be to publish a static website without paying for hosting. I feel more confident using GitHub not just for coding, but also as a tool to share content and projects with others online. I plan to try building a basic portfolio page to apply what I learned today. I’m also excited to use this skill to improve our ongoing group project by possibly creating a GitHub-hosted project site.
