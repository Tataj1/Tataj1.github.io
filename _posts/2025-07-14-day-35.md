what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned how to connect my interactive Streamlit dashboard with my static GitHub Pages website. I explored different hosting options, especially Streamlit Cloud, which allows me to deploy my app and then link it to my webpage. I also learned how to embed buttons and iframes inside the HTML page to provide dashboard access from the existing site layout. Additionally, I participated in our team video discussion. It was insightful to see how others approached similar deployment challenges and how they integrated interactive tools. One takeaway was the importance of choosing the right balance between dynamic features and static hosting limitations.
  
blockers: |  
  The biggest challenge was figuring out how to combine a dynamic Streamlit app with a static GitHub Pages structure, since GitHub Pages cannot directly run Python-based apps. It took some research to find a clean way to link them without breaking the website.

reflection: |
  Working on dashboard deployment taught me how frontend and backend components need to be properly separated and hosted. I now understand how to direct users from a static site to a hosted web app while keeping the user experience smooth and intuitive. It feels great to make real progress toward getting our full dashboard live and accessible to users. Participating in the video discussion also reminded me how valuable peer exchange is during these stages of the project.
