what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned the importance of reviewing each component of the project with a fresh perspective. We revisited our dashboard script, validated its outputs, and ensured alignment with the insights we plan to present. I also explored how to summarize technical processes effectively for a broader audience, which will help in final documentation. Additionally, I gained a better understanding of how to prioritize revisions by impact, focusing on areas that directly affect user experience and interpretability. The process also helped me reinforce the value of version control and careful testing before deployment.

  None today. The workflow was smooth, and all discussions and tasks were productive.
  
reflection: |
  As the project wraps up, I'm feeling proud of how far we’ve come as a team. Today’s focused collaboration reminded me how crucial peer feedback and steady iteration are to building a complete and effective product. I also felt more confident in handling final deliverables, and it was rewarding to see everything come together. Seeing our early concepts evolve into a well-structured dashboard and documentation has been deeply fulfilling. I’ve grown not only in technical skill but also in communication and teamwork, and today really highlighted that progress.
