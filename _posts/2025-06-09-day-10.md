what_i_learned: |
  Today, I celebrated Eid with my loved ones, so I took the day off from work and research activities.
  
blockers: |  
  None today—taking time to rest and reflect. 
  
reflection: |
  Taking a step back today reminded me why I’m passionate about my research. The AI solutions I’m developing have real-world potential to help airlines make smarter, greener decisions. Even though I didn’t work today, organizing my Zotero library recently will definitely help streamline my report writing moving forward. I’m excited to get back to work tomorrow with renewed energy.
