what_i_learned: |
  Today I explored Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python and the pandas library. I watched four in-depth tutorial videos including content from Data Professor and live coding sessions involving flight delay datasets. I learned how to import data, inspect data frames, clean missing values, generate statistical summaries, and create visualizations using basic pandas functions. I also practiced with real-world datasets and gained confidence in using .head(), .info(), .describe(), .groupby(), and visualization methods.

  Initially, I found it challenging to fully understand some of the more complex dataset manipulations like multi-level grouping and chaining multiple pandas methods. However, pausing the videos and practicing each step in Colab helped me overcome those difficulties.
  
reflection: |
  This was a very productive workday. Watching structured tutorials and seeing real-life applications of pandas made me realize the power of Python in handling and understanding data. Practicing along with the instructors helped reinforce my skills. It also connected well to our flight delay prediction project, giving me practical tools I can apply soon. I feel more equipped to work with datasets and excited to dive deeper into modeling next.
