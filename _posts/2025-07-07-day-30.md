what_i_learned: |
  Today I focused on researching how to build a real-time interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash. I explored how Dash works with components like graphs, input fields, and callback functions to make live updates. I also looked into how to connect a trained ML model to the dashboard to show predictions and insights in real time. I learned about how Dash integrates Plotly for visualizations and how you can simulate real-time updates using the dcc.Interval component. I also discovered best practices for structuring the layout and maintaining modular callbacks for scalability.
  
blockers: |  
  No blockers today since this was a research-focused task. I didn’t implement the dashboard yet, but the planning is now clear for moving forward.
  
reflection: |
  This research gave me a solid understanding of how to connect machine learning predictions with live web-based dashboards. Plotly Dash seems like a great tool since it only uses Python and doesn’t require separate front-end development. I feel confident about building the dashboard in the next steps. I also realized how important it is to plan the data flow between user input, model, and output visualizations. Learning about layout best practices will help me build a user-friendly dashboard that communicates insights clearly.
