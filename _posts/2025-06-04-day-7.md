what_i_learned: |
  Today, I spent time exploring several research papers focused on how aviation affects the climate. I learned that it’s not just about CO₂ contrails, soot, and nitrogen oxides can also cause major environmental impacts. I read about different strategies researchers are testing, like changing flight altitudes or routes to reduce emissions. It was fascinating to see how these scientific findings align with what I’m trying to do in my project—using AI to help predict delays and make smarter, more climate friendly flight decisions.

  At first, some of the technical terms especially around atmospheric models and soot-cirrus cloud interactions felt a bit overwhelming. But once I broke them down and connected them to real flight operations, they started to make a lot more sense.

reflection: |
  Reviewing these papers really boosted my confidence in the direction of my project. While most of the studies focus on the scientific or policy side, I realized that my work brings those ideas to life through a practical AI tool. I’m building something that can actually support airlines and airports in making better choices—both for people and the planet. I also organized all my readings in Zotero, which will definitely make writing my final report easier. Overall, a productive and inspiring day!
