what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned how to effectively prepare for a research presentation. Our graduate mentor and high school teacher helped guide us through structuring our slides and refining our speaking points. This helped us understand how to be more precise and descriptive when explaining complex ideas. I also continued working on the machine learning part of our flight delay prediction project. We reviewed the model performance using different evaluation metrics. Accuracy shows the percentage of correct predictions, while recall tells us how well the model identifies actual delayed flights. The F1 score balances both precision and recall, giving a better sense of overall performance in imbalanced datasets. Additionally, we looked at error metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error). RMSE penalizes larger errors more heavily and is useful when we care about big mistakes. MAE gives the average error size, helping us understand how far off our predictions are on average.

  I felt a bit nervous while practicing the presentation. It’s sometimes hard to stay confident while speaking in front of others, especially when I want everything to go perfectly. However, with support from our mentors and more practice, I'm improving.
  
reflection: |
  Working with my team and mentors today was really helpful. Preparing for the presentation together also reminded me that it’s okay to be nervous — everyone starts somewhere, and support from others can make a big difference. I’m feeling more prepared and encouraged to present our work confidently. Exploring the ML evaluation metrics also gave me more insight into how to choose the right measures for different goals — like classification vs. forecasting. I now better understand how to interpret our results and improve the model further.
