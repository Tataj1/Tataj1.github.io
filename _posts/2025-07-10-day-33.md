what_i_learned: |
  Today’s workshop highlighted how writing and researching are deeply connected in technical fields. I learned about the structure and key sections of a formal IEEE-style technical paper, especially the importance of clarity, accuracy, and completeness. The idea that writing can serve both as a roadmap and a vehicle for communicating research was especially insightful. I also learned to identify research gaps from literature, and how outlining, brainstorming, and team discussions can strengthen the final output. Additionally, I continued working on my Plotly Dash dashboard for flight delay prediction. I refined the output display, which now combines real-time weather impact scoring with historical delay patterns for more informative results.
  
blockers: |  
  There were no major blockers today, but I am still using simulated weather data instead of a real API, which slightly limits real-world testing. I need to get an OpenWeatherMap API key and finalize the input validations for unexpected airport codes.
  
reflection: |
  The workshop made me realize how important professional language, structure, and ethical writing are for technical credibility. I found the checklist on technical communication (PEACC: Professionalism, Ethicality, Accuracy, Clarity, Completeness) very helpful and will apply it to my final project report. It also reminded me to avoid passive reading—now I approach articles by looking for the research gap, method, and results to guide my own work. My dashboard work today felt rewarding. Seeing it predict and explain flight delays dynamically felt like a real application of AI. Combining weather and flight data to generate clear, actionable output aligns perfectly with what the workshop taught: that good research must be both informative and usable.
