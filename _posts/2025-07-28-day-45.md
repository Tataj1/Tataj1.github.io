what_i_learned: |
  Today, I focused on refining the final report and preparing visuals that summarize our entire summer project. I gained a clearer understanding of how to structure technical documentation and articulate model performance, system architecture, and challenges effectively. I also reviewed our data pipeline, from FAA and weather data ingestion to model deployment using XGBoost and Flask. Additionally, I revisited the LSTM time series model section to ensure clarity in explaining its strengths and limitations. I also practiced presenting the final slide deck to enhance my delivery and ensure alignment with the project goals.

  None today. The workflow was smooth, and all discussions and tasks were productive.
  
reflection: |
  As we approach the final stretch, I’m realizing how much we’ve accomplished from handling 8M+ flight records to developing a climate-aware delay prediction dashboard. Even with limited computing resources and diverse backgrounds on the team, we collaborated well and built something impactful. I'm proud of the effort we've all put in, and I'm more confident now in applying AI to real-world problems. This experience has not only strengthened my technical skills in machine learning and data analysis but also improved my ability to communicate and work collaboratively in a research environment. Looking back, each challenge taught me something valuable, and I feel more prepared to take on future interdisciplinary projects.
