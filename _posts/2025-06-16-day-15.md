what_i_learned: |
  Today, I practiced more advanced SQL techniques in BigQuery, especially using JOINs to combine data across multiple tables.
I learned how to filter large datasets efficiently using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to avoid exceeding byte limits.
I used SQL’s LIKE operator to filter tags, reviewed answer-question relationships using parent_id, and wrote a query to join posts_answers and posts_questions for questions tagged with “bigquery”. I also improved my understanding of query structure and billing limits, which helped me troubleshoot internal server errors related to excessive data scanned. Additionally, I reviewed and commented on two other groups' video presentations. One team worked on using deep learning to detect driver drowsiness based on facial cues like eye closure and yawning. I was especially impressed by their use of ensemble CNN models and how they tackled GPU challenges to reduce training time. I asked them how they selected the models for their ensemble and if any outcomes surprised them during testing. Their technical depth and teamwork stood out clearly.
  
blockers: |  
  I initially encountered errors because the query exceeded the 10GB limit.
The JOIN was scanning too much data, so I had to optimize by filtering before joining.
I also struggled with tag matching—%bigquery% wasn’t catching properly formatted tags like <bigquery>, so it took a while to find the right wildcard pattern.
Additionally, loading the peer videos was a bit slow due to internet lag, but I was still able to give constructive feedback in time.
  
reflection: |
  This was one of the most technical and rewarding days. I learned that writing efficient queries is just as important as writing correct ones, especially when working with large-scale public datasets. Getting the JOIN to work after applying filters in the CTE was satisfying, and it taught me how real-world data analysis often requires iteration, debugging, and rethinking the approach. I feel more confident now working with relational datasets and optimizing my code for performance.
Watching my peers' work also gave me ideas on project storytelling and problem framing, and I’m excited to apply that to our own AI project. The drowsiness detection project especially inspired me because of its real-world application in driver safety.
