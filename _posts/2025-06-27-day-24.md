what_i_learned: |
  Today, I participated in a virtual academic program hosted by Cornell University Graduate School. The session was part of a professional development opportunity that aligns closely with my future academic and career goals. I learned about various graduate pathways, application strategies, and how to navigate the transition from undergraduate research to advanced studies. Sessions included presentations from graduate mentors and interactive Q&A, which helped me better understand what top graduate schools are looking for.

  Since I was attending the program throughout the day, I was unable to work on my summer project tasks today. However, this opportunity gave me valuable insights that will contribute to my future academic planning.
  
reflection: |
  I’m grateful to have had the chance to attend this program. It gave me clarity about graduate school expectations and reinforced the importance of long-term planning and networking. I’ve also submitted my absence dismissal form for today to make sure everything is documented. This experience reminded me that personal and academic growth go hand in hand, and taking opportunities like this can positively influence my future path.
