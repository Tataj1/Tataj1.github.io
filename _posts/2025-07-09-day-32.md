what_i_learned: |
  Today, I focused on developing an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash. I explored how to integrate real-time user input for flight delay prediction while incorporating weather data. I also learned how to structure the app layout using Dash components like `dcc.Input`, `html.Div`, and callbacks with `@app.callback`. The goal was to make the prediction interface clean and informative while processing input data dynamically through the XGBoost model.
  
blockers: |  
  One minor blocker was handling datetime and weather feature parsing for the user inputs, which required reshaping the inputs correctly before passing to the model. I was able to resolve it with some preprocessing tweaks.
  
reflection: |
  We also did a fun and insightful team building activity today. Our high school teacher gave us a topic, and each person shared their thoughts based on it. It helped us think creatively, listen to each other, and collaborate more effectively. I realized how important it is to combine technical knowledge with soft skills like communication and teamwork. Overall, today gave me a better understanding of both technical implementation and human interaction in project work.
