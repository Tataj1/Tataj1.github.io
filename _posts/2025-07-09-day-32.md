what_i_learned: |
  Today, I focused on developing an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash. I explored how to integrate real-time user input for flight delay prediction while incorporating weather data. I also learned how to structure the app layout using Dash components like dcc.Input, html.Div, and callbacks with @app.callback. The goal was to make the prediction interface clean and informative while processing input data dynamically through the XGBoost model. Additionally, I explored how to validate user inputs and update prediction outputs instantly, which helped me understand the importance of state and context in Dash callbacks. I also gained insight into how different components interact and how data flows between frontend input and backend model predictions. This experience boosted both my frontend layout design and backend integration skills.
  
blockers: |  
  One minor blocker was handling datetime and weather feature parsing for the user inputs, which required reshaping the inputs correctly before passing to the model. I was able to resolve it with some preprocessing tweaks.
  
reflection: |
  We also did a fun and insightful team building activity today. Our high school teacher gave us a topic, and each person shared their thoughts based on it. It helped us think creatively, listen to each other, and collaborate more effectively. I realized how important it is to combine technical knowledge with soft skills like communication and teamwork. Overall, today gave me a better understanding of both technical implementation and human interaction in project work. The activity reminded me that solving real-world problems often requires diverse perspectives and effective teamwork. We each brought something unique to the discussion, which made our ideas stronger. I appreciated the safe space it created to express ideas freely and reflect on our own growth. These types of experiences help strengthen team bonds and make collaboration smoother and more productive.
