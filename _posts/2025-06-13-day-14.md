what_i_learned: |
  Today, I focused on strengthening my understanding of core data analysis tools and machine learning concepts. I revisited libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. These tools helped me learn how to manipulate datasets, clean and analyze data, and calculate central tendency measures such as mean, median, and mode. I practiced interpreting these values and explored visualizations like histograms for distribution, scatter plots for bivariate analysis, and box plots for detecting outliers. I also spent time reviewing the XGBoost model and began applying it to small datasets. On top of that, I practiced converting date columns into meaningful features—like extracting the day of the week or month—during the feature engineering process.

  One major challenge was recognizing and selecting the appropriate type of plot for different scenarios. I sometimes found it confusing to differentiate when to use scatter plots versus histograms, especially when analyzing relationships versus distributions. Another area I found difficult was customizing Seaborn and Matplotlib plots to make them more readable. Also, understanding when to use mean versus median for central tendency, especially in skewed datasets, took some extra effort.
  
reflection: |
  This week gave me a much clearer picture of how to move from raw data to insightful analysis. I now see how crucial it is to combine statistical summaries with visual interpretation to tell a data story effectively. I’m proud of my progress, especially in handling data transformations and visualizations. Although I couldn’t be in the lab for the full day due to my mother’s illness—I had to leave early to be with her—I still made the best of my time by continuing to review materials and practice remotely. Balancing family responsibilities with learning was tough, but it reminded me why staying consistent and flexible is important in any learning journey.
