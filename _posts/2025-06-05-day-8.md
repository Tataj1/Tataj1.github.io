what_i_learned: |
  Today, we started the day with a campus tour, which was a great way to explore Morgan and bond with fellow interns. After lunch, we returned to the lab and created our Week 2 team video a bit early since I will be out tomorrow for Eid. Later in the day, we worked on exploring a dataset related to our project using Google Colab. Our mentor guided us through the basics of data handling and helped us understand how to interpret the dataset — it was especially helpful since many of us are still new to this. Lastly, we presented our project plan to our faculty mentor, summarizing everything we accomplished throughout the week. I shared that I reviewed and summarized 16 research papers and explained how I connected their findings to my own research topic.

  At first, it was a bit confusing to know how to load and manipulate the dataset in Google Colab. Understanding the data structure and how to use the tools was challenging, but our graduate mentor's support really helped.
  
reflection: |
  Reviewing the dataset in Google Colab gave me a clearer picture of how data connects to our research topic. I feel more confident now using Colab and working with datasets. Filming the team video early was also a nice bonding activity, and I'm grateful we could accommodate my absence tomorrow for Eid. Presenting our project plan to the faculty mentor helped me reflect on how much progress we've made this week and how my literature review is aligning with our broader goals. Today balanced both learning and team collaboration really well.
