what_i_learned: |
  Today, I focused on understanding the structure and flow of a strong final research report. I explored how to effectively present our methods, results, and discussion sections in a clear and organized way. I also learned how important it is to align the report writing with the original problem statement and research questions. Reviewing past examples gave me insights on technical formatting, transition flow between sections, and the integration of visualizations.

  One challenge was figuring out how to summarize all of our weekly progress without missing any key parts. It took time to decide what to prioritize in the final report outline. Also, aligning our group’s input into a single narrative format requires coordination and clarity.
  
reflection: |
  As we near the final phase of our project, we worked on brainstorming the structure of our final research report. It was helpful to break down what sections we need and how we want to present our findings. We also recorded our weekly video to highlight our accomplishments, progress, and challenges for the week. This was a great way to reflect on our journey and prepare ourselves for final presentation and documentation. Each week builds on the last, and it's exciting to see everything come together.
