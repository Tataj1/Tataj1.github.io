what_i_learned: |
  Today, I practiced advanced SQL skills including different types of joins (INNER, LEFT, OUTER) and used them to successfully merge multiple datasets. I also cleaned the merged data by removing missing values and checking for consistency across key fields. These steps were essential for preparing the dataset for analysis and modeling. I completed four Kaggle tutorials and earned certificates in the process, which helped me understand essential topics like data wrangling, visualization, and feature engineering. We also played a Kahoot quiz game based on these Kaggle concepts, which made reviewing the material fun and interactive.

  While merging datasets, I initially ran into trouble with mismatched column names and unexpected null values. It took a few tries to align the keys properly and make sure the final dataset made sense. One of my SQL queries was also running slowly until I optimized the filters and restructured the CTE logic.
  
reflection: |
   Today was both productive and encouraging. I’m proud of earning the four Kaggle certificates—it felt like a real milestone in understanding practical data science. The SQL practice and dataset merging helped strengthen my confidence in handling real-world data problems. The Kahoot quiz was a fun way to reinforce key concepts, and I enjoyed interacting with my team through feedback and discussion. I'm excited to apply all of this to my upcoming projects.
