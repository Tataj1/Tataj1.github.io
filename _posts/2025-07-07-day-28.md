what_i_learned: |
  Today I focused on researching how to build a real-time interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash. I explored how Dash works with components like graphs, input fields, and callback functions to make live updates. I also looked into how to connect a trained ML model to the dashboard to show predictions and insights in real time.
  
blockers: |  
  No blockers today since this was a research-focused task. I didn’t implement the dashboard yet, but the planning is now clear for moving forward.
  
reflection: |
  This research gave me a solid understanding of how to connect machine learning predictions with live web-based dashboards. Plotly Dash seems like a great tool since it only uses Python and doesn’t require separate front-end development. I feel confident about building the dashboard in the next steps.
