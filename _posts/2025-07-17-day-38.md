what_i_learned: |
  Today, we participated in a writing workshop where I learned how to identify and articulate a research gap, construct a solid background, and develop a clear and structured methodology and abstract. I also learned the value of discussing the shortcomings of a study to strengthen its credibility. The Kahoot quiz we played during the session made the learning process more engaging and helped reinforce these concepts. Additionally, the hands-on aspect of reviewing our own work helped solidify my understanding of how to apply these writing principles effectively.
  
blockers: |  
  No major blockers today, but it was a bit challenging to clearly define the research gap without overgeneralizing or being too narrow. I plan to revisit some related literature to improve clarity.
  
reflection: |
  Today’s writing workshop was highly informative and interactive. The session helped me better understand the components of academic writing, especially how to effectively frame the problem and methodology. The Kahoot quiz was a fun way to reinforce what we learned and test our understanding in real-time. Later, I had a productive meeting with my faculty mentor, where we discussed our weekly progress and worked together. This collaborative effort helped me reflect on what we’ve achieved and where we can improve going forward.
