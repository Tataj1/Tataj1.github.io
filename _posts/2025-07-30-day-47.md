what_i_learned: |
  Today, I focused on refining the final presentation materials and blog content. I learned how small wording changes and structural tweaks can greatly improve clarity and impact. I also reviewed peer content, which helped me better understand how to make my own writing more engaging and concise. Additionally, I explored how to summarize complex research into digestible visual formats, which is a skill I will carry forward. I practiced giving and receiving feedback constructively, and it reinforced how important collaboration is when working toward a shared goal.

  None today. The workflow was smooth, and all discussions and tasks were productive.
  
reflection: |
  It’s hard to believe the summer research journey is wrapping up. Looking back, I’ve grown not just technically, but also in communication and collaboration. Today’s final touches felt like the last pieces of a big puzzle falling into place. I feel proud of what I’ve contributed and excited about how this experience will shape my future work. This experience has deepened my interest in applying AI to real-world problems, especially in aviation and climate resilience. I’ve also developed more confidence in presenting my work and articulating complex ideas. Most importantly, I’ve learned the value of perseverance, teamwork, and continuous learning throughout this meaningful journey.
