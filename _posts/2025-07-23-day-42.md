what_i_learned: |
  Today, I deepened my understanding of how to professionally present system architecture and data pipelines in an engineering-style block diagram. I learned the differences between a standard diagram and an engineering-focused one—such as using proper modular blocks, directional arrows for data flow, and clean formatting with software like draw.io and Lucidchart. Additionally, I refined the project summary and clarified how each module—from data collection to deployment—connects to our AI flight delay prediction system. I also explored how to represent the modeling pipeline and dashboard integration in a visually intuitive and publication ready format.

  I’m still finalizing how to visualize the LSTM time series model within the diagram without overcrowding the design. Also, I need to ensure the weather simulation component is represented in a way that’s both technically accurate and easy for non-experts to understand.
  
reflection: |
  Today was productive as I transitioned from content-heavy research into the visual communication phase of our project. Turning abstract workflows into a clean, professional block diagram forced me to think critically about the logic and flow of our system. It also helped me identify minor gaps in our data pipeline which I plan to clarify during tomorrow’s team meeting. Visual design isn’t just about aesthetics it’s about making our research accessible and understandable. I’m proud of how much progress I’ve made in representing our work clearly and professionally.
