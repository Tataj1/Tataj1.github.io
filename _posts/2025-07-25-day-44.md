what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned about fascinating applications of neurotechnology in controlling drones using brain waves and robots using muscle signals. We were introduced to these innovative projects through a short presentation and hands-on exploration. It was inspiring to see how brain-computer and muscle-machine interfaces are shaping the future of human-computer interaction. I gained insight into how bio-signals are acquired, processed, and translated into commands that machines can understand. This expanded my understanding of signal acquisition systems, wearable tech, and real-time control applications. Additionally, I strengthened my understanding of system design while working on the block diagram and writing the project summary for our research. This helped me better connect the dots between concept, implementation, and presentation.

  None today. The workflow was smooth, and all discussions and tasks were productive.
  
reflection: |
  Meeting Dr. Chris Crawford from the University of Alabama and learning about his projects under the theme "Mind Meets Machine" was incredibly motivating. The hands-on experience gave me a new perspective on how human signals can be used for intelligent control systems. It was also a reminder of how interdisciplinary innovation combining neuroscience, engineering, and computer science—can lead to powerful, life-changing technologies. Later, we returned to our lab, met with our graduate mentor, and presented our progress. She provided thoughtful feedback and encouragement, which gave me a boost of confidence. I finalized updates to the block diagram and refined our project summary. Overall, it was a productive and inspiring day that made me feel more connected to both the goals of our research and the broader impact it can have.
