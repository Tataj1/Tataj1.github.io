what_i_learned: |
  Today, we began by meeting our faculty lead and research mentor. We discussed the scope of our group project titled **"AI-Driven Flight Delay Prediction Model for Climate-Resilient Flight Management."** It was exciting to understand the real-world impact and goals of our research.

  During the coding session, I reviewed foundational Python concepts such as lists, sets, and dictionaries, and we ran some basic code to reinforce these ideas. Later in the day, we played a Hazmats game as a team-building activity — it was a fun and engaging way to wrap up the day.

blockers: |
  No blockers today! The project discussion and Python session went smoothly. I just plan to spend some time practicing basic Python structures to feel more confident.

reflection: |
  Meeting our research mentor and diving into the project made everything feel more real and exciting. I enjoyed revisiting Python basics — it’s a good foundation for the work we’ll be doing. The Hazmats game was a great way to bond with the group and added some fun to the day!
