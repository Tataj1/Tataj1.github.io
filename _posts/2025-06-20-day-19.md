  Today, I focused on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) tasks. I finalized my weekly progress update slide and created a video summarizing both my accomplishments and challenges. My work this week included cleaning the dataset, selecting relevant features, and initiating basic visualizations. Instead of simply using a relevant image from google, I designed a custom visual image to better represent my progress, which helped me improve my skills in presenting data more effectively. I also deepened my understanding of handling missing values—learning when to fill them with zeros and when to remove them based on context. Additionally, I reviewed techniques for sorting and organizing columns to prepare the data for further analysis.

  Initially, I was confused about how to create a meaningful graphic to reflect my weekly progress and also had difficulty choosing between options for handling missing values. It took some trial and error to decide which method best suited my dataset and project goal.
  
reflection: |
   Today boosted my confidence in using visual techniques to effectively communicate my data work. By designing a relevant graphic instead of simply inserting a image from google, I was able to make my project overview more engaging and informative. I’m starting to see how each preprocessing step—such as removing irrelevant columns or handling missing values—plays an important role in building a strong predictive model. Moving forward, I plan to dive deeper into advanced EDA, address inconsistencies in time-related columns, and begin working with machine learning models like XGBoost and Random Forest.
