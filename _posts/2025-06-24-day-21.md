what_i_learned: |
  Today I focused on testing simple machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Decision Trees using my cleaned flight delay dataset. I trained and evaluated these models to predict flight delays using features like time, location, and airline. I also learned how to split data properly using train_test_split, scale the features using StandardScaler, and apply performance metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report to interpret results. These classic models helped me establish baseline performance for comparison with more advanced models later.
  
blockers: |  
  One blocker I encountered was selecting appropriate evaluation metrics. Since this is a classification task (delay vs. no delay), I needed to ensure my output labels were formatted correctly. At one point, I accidentally used mean squared error, which is for regression. Switching to classification metrics like accuracy and F1-score resolved that. Another issue was model overfitting when using a Decision Tree with default parameters — I fixed it by adjusting the tree depth.
  
reflection: |
   Testing simple ML models gave me a solid foundation for my flight delay prediction project. It helped me understand the importance of preprocessing and choosing the right model type and evaluation metric. These models may be basic, but they are interpretable and run efficiently even on large datasets. This experience is useful for comparing future models and improving prediction accuracy while keeping things explainable and lightweight.
