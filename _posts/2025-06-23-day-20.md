what_i_learned: |
  Today, I focused on learning the theoretical concepts behind different machine learning models used in flight delay prediction. I gained a better understanding of how baseline models work as reference points, especially in imbalanced datasets, and how Logistic Regression serves as a simple linear classifier. I also studied how Decision Trees can handle complex, non-linear relationships and provide more balanced predictions. In addition, I reviewed a published research paper on airline delay prediction that used Decision Trees. It helped me understand their hyperparameter tuning process and why Decision Trees can be effective even without advanced deep learning techniques. This learning will help guide our model-building steps.
  
blockers: |  
  Colab kept crashing due to memory limitations when loading the full historical dataset, so I couldn’t run or test any models today. I will now look into setting up the same environment locally using VS Code to handle the data more effectively.
  
reflection: |
   Even though I didn’t run any models today, understanding the theory behind them was valuable. I now see how Logistic Regression and Decision Trees fit into the broader model selection pipeline. This foundational knowledge will help me implement and evaluate models more confidently when I begin practical work. I also realized the importance of having the right computing setup, especially when dealing with large datasets.
