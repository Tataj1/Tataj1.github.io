what_i_learned: |
  Today, I worked on preparing and polishing the visuals for our AI-based flight delay prediction model. I learned how to effectively use confusion matrices, ROC curves, and performance plots (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score) to evaluate model performance and communicate results clearly. I also learned how to write a clear and concise script for a research presentation, focusing only on progress, challenges, solutions, and next steps. I learned how to shorten complex slides into simple, visually engaging graphics that reflect the message without relying on text.
  
blockers: |  
  One of the challenges I faced was deciding how much technical detail to include in the presentation. It was also difficult to simplify the "Challenges & Solutions" section while keeping it meaningful. I overcame this by focusing on key points and rewriting multiple drafts with feedback from mentors.
  
reflection: |
  Today's task helped me better understand the importance of presenting technical work in a clean and digestible way. Instead of showing every detail, I focused on communicating insights clearly. This process also improved my design and storytelling skills—especially when translating technical performance into visual language. I now feel more confident in explaining our project to a broader audience and am excited for the tomorrow presentation.
