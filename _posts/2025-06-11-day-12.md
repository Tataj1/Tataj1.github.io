what_i_learned: |
  Today, I explored several important tools and concepts in data analysis using Python and the Pandas library. I practiced sorting data using ascending and descending order. I understood how `ascending=False` sorts in descending order. I learned the difference between `df.info()` and `df.describe()`—the former gives data types and memory usage, while the latter provides statistical summaries. I used `df.nunique()` to check for unique values in each column and practiced string cleaning using `.str.strip()`. I also learned about mean and central tendency, explored Gaussian (normal) distribution, and recognized the look of scatter plots. Lastly, I distinguished between data scaling (like normalization/standardization) and feature engineering (creating new features).

  Sometimes I got confused between similar-sounding Pandas functions like `.info()` vs `.describe()`. Understanding when to use scaling versus feature engineering also took some time to grasp. I needed quick answers during the Kahoot quiz and struggled to process the questions fast enough in 15 seconds.
  
reflection: |
  It was a productive day filled with hands-on practice and learning through visuals and examples. I feel more confident interpreting different types of data and distributions. The visual explanation of scatter plots and normal distributions helped me understand the concepts faster. Even though I had small confusions, repeated practice helped clear things up. I’m excited to apply these skills in real-world datasets and future AI models.
