what_i_learned: |
  Today, I focused on refining the block diagram and data pipeline for our final research paper. I learned how each component of our system fits into the broader architecture—from data collection and preprocessing to model training, prediction, and dashboard integration. I also explored how to clearly represent this in a professional engineering-style diagram that communicates the end-to-end workflow effectively.
  
blockers: |  
  Designing the block diagram to look clean yet informative took some time. I had to revise the flow several times to make sure it logically showed how raw data flows into predictions and gets displayed through our dashboard.
  
reflection: |
  Working on the system architecture helped me better understand the entire lifecycle of our flight delay prediction model. Explaining each module for the paper—like how we collect weather and flight data, clean and process it, train machine learning models (like XGBoost), and serve predictions to users—made me appreciate the complexity of building a real-world AI system. Visualizing the pipeline also helped clarify our project’s technical depth and will strengthen our final report.
