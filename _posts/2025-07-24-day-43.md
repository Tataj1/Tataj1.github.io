what_i_learned: |
  Today, I worked extensively on designing and improving the block diagram and data pipeline for our final paper. I learned how to break down a complex AI workflow into smaller, modular components and represent them visually. This includes modules like data collection, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment. I also gained a better understanding of how to sequence these stages to reflect the real-world process of building and deploying a predictive system. While designing, I also reviewed the functionality of each element in our tech stack such as Python libraries (scikit-learn, XGBoost), APIs for weather data (Visual Crossing), and the dashboard tools (Flask/Dash). I learned how important it is to maintain logical flow and clarity in engineering diagrams to communicate ideas effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences.

  Designing the block diagram to look clean yet informative took some time. I had to revise the flow several times to make sure it logically showed how raw data flows into predictions and gets displayed through our dashboard.
  
reflection: |
  Working on the block diagram and data pipeline gave me a clearer picture of how all the components of our project are interconnected. It’s not just about training a model—it’s about building a robust, end-to-end system that starts with raw datasets and ends with real-time predictions for end users. Creating this visual representation allowed me to think deeply about how each step contributes to the overall performance and reliability of our flight delay prediction system. It also helped prepare strong content for our final report, as I now feel more confident explaining both the architecture and logic behind our AI approach. This task has strengthened my understanding of system design and how essential clear communication is in technical writing.
