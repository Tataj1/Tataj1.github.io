what_i_learned: |
  Today was a full and exciting day. We started with a group presentation where our faculty mentors introduced themselves and shared details about their research projects. It was inspiring to hear about the different areas of AI and machine learning they are working on. We also took a group photo with all the project team members. Later, we played the Marshmallow Challenge game, which was a fun and creative team-building activity. Back in the research lab, I received my new laptop for the summer program and successfully set it up. I also began exploring research papers related to my project using Google Scholar and the Morgan Library resources. Toward the end of the day, we had a meeting about the rules and regulations for working in the DEPA lab.

  There weren’t any major blockers today, but getting familiar with the research tools and online libraries took a little time. Setting up the laptop also required some initial configurations, but everything went smoothly overall.

reflection: |
  Today gave me a broader perspective on the research environment and helped me feel more connected to the CEAMLS community. Hearing from the faculty about their work was motivating, and the team activities helped build a sense of collaboration. I’m also excited to have my own laptop set up and ready for use—it makes me feel more prepared to dive deeper into my research. Looking at academic papers was a good first step in understanding the background of my project. I'm eager to keep learning and contributing.
