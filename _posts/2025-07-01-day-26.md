what_i_learned: |
  Today I focused on organizing and summarizing all of our progress for the upcoming project presentation. We compiled our machine learning workflow, analysis results, and visualizations into a clear, structured slide deck. This review helped me better understand the flow of our data pipeline and how each step contributes to the final output. Also, I explored how artificial intelligence can be used creatively to generate music. We learned how to provide personal stories, themes, or emotions as input, and the AI transformed them into songs. This opened my eyes to the connection between technology and self-expression. I also got more comfortable discussing my background and how it shapes my goals.

  Summarizing a month’s worth of work into concise slides while keeping them informative was challenging. Selecting the most relevant visualizations and explaining our model’s performance in simple terms took multiple revisions.
  
reflection: |
  Most of today’s time was dedicated to preparing our project presentation for Thursday. We reviewed all our work, from data preprocessing and feature selection to model training and evaluation. Our team finalized the slides to ensure they include performance metrics like accuracy, recall, and RMSE, along with visuals such as confusion matrices and error comparisons. We also met with our faculty mentor to walk through the code and slides. His input helped us confirm we’re on the right track. Although we had a short team-building activity where we created songs using personal stories through the Suno AI music app, the main highlight was consolidating and presenting the technical depth of our summer research.
