what_i_learned: |
  Today I explored how artificial intelligence can be used creatively to generate music. We learned how to provide personal stories, themes, or emotions as input, and the AI transformed them into songs. This opened my eyes to the connection between technology and self-expression. I also got more comfortable discussing my background and how it shapes my goals.

blockers: |  
  It was a little challenging at first to summarize deep personal experiences into short lyrics for AI-generated music. Finding the right balance between storytelling and simplicity took a few tries.
  
reflection: |
  Today was both emotional and inspiring. During our team-building session, everyone shared personal life stories and meaningful experiences, which helped us understand each other better and build stronger bonds. It reminded me how powerful it is to connect through vulnerability and creativity. Later, we took those experiences and used an AI tool to generate original music based on our stories. Seeing our lives turned into song was a beautiful and memorable way to blend technology with personal expression.
