what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned how to use Google Colab to run Ultralytics' YOLOv8 model on an image.
I practiced uploading files using files.upload() and running object detection on a static image.
I also understood how to load a pre-trained YOLO model and generate output with bounding boxes around detected objects.
Additionally, I practiced packaging and downloading result files from the Colab environment.

During the puzzle game activity, I practiced analyzing visual clues, asking yes/no questions, and collaborating with others to solve logical mysteries. It helped improve my critical thinking and group interaction skills.

In Andrew’s presentation, I gained insight into how AI is impacting fields like art, storytelling, and ethics. I learned about using prompts effectively with AI tools and saw real-world examples of how technology can amplify creativity and spark meaningful discussions.
