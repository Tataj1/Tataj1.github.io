what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned how to use Google Colab to run Ultralytics' YOLOv8 model on an image. I practiced uploading files using files.upload() and running object detection on a static image. I also understood how to load a pre-trained YOLO model and generate output with bounding boxes around detected objects. Additionally, I practiced packaging and downloading result files from the Colab environment. During the puzzle game activity, I practiced analyzing visual clues, asking yes/no questions, and collaborating with others to solve logical mysteries. It helped improve my critical thinking and group interaction skills. In Andrew’s presentation, I gained insight into how AI is impacting fields like art, storytelling, and ethics. I learned about using prompts effectively with AI tools and saw real-world examples of how technology can amplify creativity and spark meaningful discussions.

blockers: |
  Initially, I fell behind and missed some instructions during class. I also wasn't sure where to write the pip install ultralytics command and how to run the model on an image instead of a video. I needed help understanding how to change the filename correctly and how to view the output. During the puzzle game, it took some time to understand how to ask the right kind of questions. I was also a little unsure how to connect Andrew’s abstract topics to technical skills at first. 

reflection: |
  Even though I started behind, I was able to catch up with clear steps. I feel more confident now using Google Colab and running AI models. It was exciting to see object detection work on my own uploaded image. The puzzle activity reminded me how important it is to stay observant, think out loud, and collaborate actively. Andrew’s session inspired me to think about AI beyond just tools—it’s about ideas, responsibility, and creativity. Next time, I’ll try to apply this to multiple images or videos and keep practicing to get more comfortable with code-based AI tools. I also want to explore how AI can help with storytelling and personal projects.
