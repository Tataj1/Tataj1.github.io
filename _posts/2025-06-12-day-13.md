what_i_learned: |
  Today, I worked virtually from home because my mom is feeling unwell. While staying with her, I focused on a Kaggle tutorial about predicting flight delays using machine learning. The tutorial guided me through using Python's Pandas library to understand and clean the dataset. I learned how to load and inspect data using Pandas functions such as pd.read_csv(), .head(), .info(), and .describe(). I also practiced checking for missing values using .isnull().sum() and grouped data with .groupby() to explore trends like average delays by airline. For visualization, I explored how to use Matplotlib and Seaborn to better understand the data. I created scatter plots to observe relationships between features such as departure time and delay duration. Histograms helped me understand the distribution of flight delays, while box plots revealed outliers and patterns across different airlines. I also used bar plots to compare flight volumes by airline or day of the week.

  Since I worked remotely today, I missed the opportunity to collaborate in person with my peers or ask questions in real-time. Some visualization code required deeper understanding of syntax and filtering, which took extra time to figure out. I also needed to revisit a few concepts like how Seaborn handles categorical variables.
  
reflection: |
  Even though I wasn’t in the lab physically, I made solid progress from home. It was meaningful to be able to support my mom and continue my learning at the same time. The hands-on practice with Pandas and visualization tools has made me more confident in working with real-world datasets. I now better understand how to uncover insights from raw data using both code and visual analysis. I look forward to continuing the tutorial and starting on modeling steps.
