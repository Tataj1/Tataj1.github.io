what_i_learned: |
  Today, I made good progress in cleaning my dataset for the AI-driven flight delay prediction project. I learned how to select only the important columns, handle missing values, extract useful features like Year, Month, and Day from the flight date, and rename columns for clarity. I also created new columns like Weather_Delay and NAS_Delay, which will help train the model to recognize climate-related delay patterns.

Outside of technical work, we went to the business building for the Sairi Cohort program. We played a fun listing game and participated in icebreakers that helped everyone feel more connected. I also met a high school teacher who joined us, which made the day even more interesting. 
  
blockers: |  
  No major blockers today, but I had to be careful when filling missing values so I didn’t accidentally remove useful rows. Understanding which columns to keep for my model took some thinking.
  
reflection: |
   It felt great to balance both technical work and social activities today. Cleaning the dataset gave me a clearer idea of how important it is to prepare the data properly before training a model. The Sairi Cohort activities were also fun — especially the listing game, which helped us get to know each other better. Meeting the high school teacher reminded me how diverse backgrounds contribute to our learning environment. Overall, today was productive and enjoyable.
