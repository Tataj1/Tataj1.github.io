what_i_learned: |
  Today, I explored how to structure and visualize the system architecture of our AI-powered flight delay prediction model. I worked on drafting a clear block diagram showing the full pipeline from data collection to deployment. I also clarified the differences between block diagrams and data pipelines, and how each serves different levels of technical explanation in a system framework. Additionally, we had an Overleaf workshop where we learned how to write and structure a research paper using Overleaf, which will help in preparing our final report.

  I found it slightly challenging to decide the best application to create professional-grade block diagrams.
  
reflection: |
  This was a productive day in terms of system-level thinking. Creating the block diagram helped me visualize how each module fits together. The Overleaf workshop was also very informative, giving me confidence in formatting and drafting our paper professionally. I feel more prepared to integrate these elements into our final report and dashboard documentation.
