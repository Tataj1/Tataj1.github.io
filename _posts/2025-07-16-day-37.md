what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned how to clearly communicate technical goals by refining the Mission, Vision, and Technical Summary on our GitHub project website. This helped clarify our project's purpose for both internal team members and external viewers. I also gained more experience working collaboratively on Overleaf to improve the writing flow and organization of our final research paper.In addition, I learned how verbal communication can influence trust, decisions, and relationships. The clip we watched explained how words carry emotional and psychological weight — they can be cold or warm, active or passive, and even function as openers or closers. When used with intention and timing, they can strengthen communication and support meaningful dialogue. I also realized the importance of using visual storytelling (like movie clips) to enhance learning — it makes abstract ideas more relatable and easier to retain.
  
blockers: |  
  No major blockers, but we're still fine-tuning some visual consistency and linking structure in the GitHub pages. Overleaf formatting also needs careful attention for final submission.
  
reflection: |
  Today’s team-building activity was both fun and impactful. We played a game called Body Language which helped us reflect on how much we say without using words. We also watched a powerful clip about verbal communication from the “Genius of Communication” course. It highlighted that effective communication involves more than just speaking — it requires emotional intelligence, timing, and a deep understanding of your audience. The clip also introduced the broader set of communication skills such as listening, conflict resolution, personal image, and etiquette — all crucial for building meaningful connections. In addition to the workshop, I worked on polishing our project’s GitHub website. I corrected formatting issues, updated the technical summary, and improved the structure of the Mission and Vision sections. The goal was to make the content clearer, more engaging, and aligned with our final research direction. I also continued contributing to our Overleaf final paper, helping refine the language and improve the flow of our literature review and methodology sections. The day was a productive mix of soft skills and research development!
