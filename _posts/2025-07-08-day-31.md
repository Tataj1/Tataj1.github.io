what_i_learned: |
  Today, I explored how to create an interactive real-time dashboard using Plotly Dash for flight delay prediction. I learned how Dash apps work with callbacks, how to structure a layout using components like dcc.Graph, html.Div, and dash_table, and how to use Input, Output, and State for dynamic updates. I also looked into uploading CSVs to trigger predictions and updating graphs or tables based on user interaction. The dashboard can visualize insights like delay probability, weather impact, and model metrics using interactive visuals.
  
blockers: |  
  I currently do not have the complete input data files (like weather or full merged CSV), so I had to test the dashboard using placeholders and dummy prediction logic. Also, understanding why VS Code needs the "!" syntax for some commands was a bit confusing, but I figured out it was due to how terminals handle shell commands inside notebooks.
  
reflection: |
  Learning how to combine machine learning with interactive visualization tools like Dash made me realize how powerful and user-friendly data apps can be. I enjoyed building the structure even though it was basic for now. I can clearly see how this will support communicating results and making our AI flight delay model accessible and useful in real time. I'm excited to connect the full pipeline soon and watch predictions update live as users interact with the dashboard.
