what_i_learned: |
  Today, I explored my personality and learning preferences through VARK and MBTI-style survey assessments. These tools helped me understand how I prefer to learn and contribute in team settings. Based on the results, I discovered that I thrive in hands-on, practical tasks and value structured guidance. I also found out how my strengths—such as critical thinking and empathy—can be valuable when working in collaborative environments. In addition, I made significant progress on our project’s GitHub website. I worked on crafting and organizing the Mission, Vision, and Technical Summary sections. The mission highlights our goal of using AI for climate-resilient airspace management, while the vision outlines the long-term impact we hope to achieve. The technical summary provides a clear overview of the tools, models (like XGBoost ), and data pipelines we’re using in our flight delay prediction system. This will help visitors understand both the purpose and the backend of our work.

  It was initially challenging to translate personal survey insights into clear, actionable steps for collaboration. Also, condensing our technical workflow into a brief yet informative summary for the GitHub page required careful thought and revision.
  
reflection: |
  Taking the time to understand myself better through surveys gave me a clearer sense of how I function within a team. It reminded me that everyone brings different strengths to a group, and recognizing these differences can improve collaboration. This will help me be more intentional in team-based tasks and communication going forward. Additionally, updating our GitHub website helped me practice presenting complex information in a concise and user-friendly format. This skill will be valuable in future academic and professional settings where clarity and impact matter.
