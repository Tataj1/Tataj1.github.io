what_i_learned: |
  Today, I explored my personality and learning preferences through VARK and MBTI-style survey assessments. These tools helped me understand how I prefer to learn and contribute in team settings. Based on the results, I discovered that I thrive in hands-on, practical tasks and value structured guidance. I also found out how my strengths—such as critical thinking and empathy—can be valuable when working in collaborative environments.

  It was a bit challenging to interpret the detailed personality profiles and understand how to apply them directly to my current research project. Translating personal traits into actionable team roles required extra reflection.
  
reflection: |
  Taking the time to understand myself better through surveys gave me a clearer sense of how I function within a team. It reminded me that everyone brings different strengths to a group, and recognizing these differences can improve collaboration. This will help me be more intentional in team-based tasks and communication going forward.
