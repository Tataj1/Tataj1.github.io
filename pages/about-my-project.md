subtitle: Climate Resilient AI & Aviation Analytics
project_title: "AI-Driven Flight Delay Prediction Model for Climate-Resilient Airspace Management"

problem: |
  Flight delays caused by adverse weather conditions significantly disrupt air travel, leading to inefficiencies and economic losses. With climate change increasing the frequency of extreme weather events, traditional delay management systems lack the predictive power and flexibility needed for modern airspace.


approach: |
  The project follows a four-phase pipeline:

  - Literature Review on AI/ML methods in aviation and climate resilience
  - Data Collection from FAA, NOAA, BTS, and OpenSky
  - Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering for model optimization
  - Model Building using: Random Forest & XGBoost for structured predictions, LSTM networks for time-series forecasting
  - Explainable AI (XAI) using SHAP/LIME for model interpretation
  - Dashboard Development with Streamlit or Plotly Dash for real-time prediction visualization

outcome: |
  By the end of the program, the project will result in a functional AI-powered dashboard for delay forecasting, a written research paper and oral presentation, a clear interpretation of model behavior and delay factors, technical skills in ML, data analysis, and visualization
