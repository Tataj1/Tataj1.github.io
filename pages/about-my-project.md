subtitle: Neural Engineering & Assistive Robotics
project_title: "NeuroLink Assist: Adaptive Robotics through Brain Signal Decoding"

problem: |
  Flight delays caused by adverse weather conditions significantly disrupt air travel, leading to inefficiencies and economic losses. With climate change increasing the frequency of extreme weather events, traditional delay management systems lack the predictive power and flexibility needed for modern airspace.


approach: |
  The project follows a four-phase pipeline:

  - Literature Review on AI/ML methods in aviation and climate resilience
  - Data Collection from FAA, NOAA, BTS, and OpenSky
  - Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering for model optimization
  - Model Building using: Random Forest & XGBoost for structured predictions, LSTM networks for time-series forecasting
  Open-source tools such as OpenBCI, Python (MNE, Scikit-learn), and ROS (Robot Operating System) will be used to prototype the system.

outcome: |
  By the end of the program, the project will result in a working prototype of a BCI-controlled robotic arm and a poster presentation outlining the system architecture, training pipeline, and evaluation metrics. Insights from the user study will inform future directions in adaptive assistive technology.
