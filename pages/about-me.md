  bio: |
    I’m a junior majoring in Electrical Engineering at Morgan State University, passionate about the intersection of artificial intelligence, embedded systems, and social impact. 

    As an international student, I bring a multicultural perspective and a deep sense of resilience to my work. I enjoy blending logic with creativity—whether it’s through coding projects, collaborative teamwork, or outreach.

    Outside of academics, I love creating, sharing, and learning in community-focused spaces—always curious, always building.
